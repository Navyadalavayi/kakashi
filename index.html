         <h2>Biography:</h2>
          Kakashi graduated from the Ninja Academy and became a Genin, when he was merely 5 years old. He later became a Jounin and a member of the AnBu Assasination squad for Hidden Leaf Village. We see him as he takes up the role as being a sensei for the new Chunnins.</p>

            Kakashi is depicted in Naruto as an eccentric but highly <i>skilled shinobi</i> for the Hidden Leaf Village. Initially cold and calculated due to the suicide of his father, Sakumo, Kakashi eventually began to warm up in his youth with the help of his teammate <i>Obito Uchiha</i>, while they are under the tutelage of Naruto's father <i>Minato Namikaze</i>. It is through Obito that Kakashi obtains the Uchiha clan's Sharingan, which he uses to copy the abilities of his opponents and make his own, but also drains his energy. Following the deaths of all of his squadmates, unaware of Obito's survival, Kakashi is eventually given charge of Team 7 due to his connections with Minato and the Uchiha, and through them is able to finally have the family he never had. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends, students, and the village becomes increasingly apparent.

Kakashi was originally created by to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that.  he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakash to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.

Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls.

    <p>  Kakashi had commitment issues of any sort, be it platonic or romantic. He had so because he lost his father at a tender age. That made him a cold person, a boy who believed love to be a burden. But it was his latter losses that made him “lazy” per say from a cold hearted one. <mark>Originally, Kakashi's primary weakness was his average reserves of chakra and stamina. He could only maintain his Sharingan for a short time, quickly tiring out from overusing it and ultimately collapsing if used too long, followed by great difficulty to even stand for days.<br>At the end of Naruto, Kakashi was around 31 years old, and he ended up becoming Hokage shortly after it. It can be safely assumed that Kakashi took over the position of Hokage around the age of 31- 32 years. He ruled as the Sixth Hokage for quite a long time and Konoha was the most peaceful under his reign.</mark>, Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, one of the most powerful shinobi Konoha ever produced, renowned throughout the ninja world as "White Fang of the Leaf". Kakashi was himself a child prodigy and, during the ninja academy years, was hailed as the best of his generation</p>
